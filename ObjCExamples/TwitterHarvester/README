During the course of completing the assignments for a version of CS193P, the course materials were updated. Previously, there had been test data provided to avoid rate limiting during development, but when that version of
the course went by the wayside, apparently so did the test data. So I wrote something quick and dirty that pulls data from the twitter api and saves it to files on disk that you can then serve yourself as test data. 

I made a little effort to stay under the rate limit of 150 requestes/hour, but it's not perfect. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
